# <Tech-Schmeck Blog>

## Description

Tech-Schmeck is a blog site designed for users to sign up, make their own posts, and comment on others' posts to discuss technology. Tech-Schmeck was built from scratch using the MVC development paradigm, using express, node, MYSQL for the database, and handlebars for the views. It is intended to be used to faciliate discourse on tech, both new and old. 

I learned much through making this application and I faced many challenges. One such was frontend JS being rejected by the application for not being of the correct type. I paraphrased. Truthfully, I'd rather not think about it. Another was figuring out how to delete posts with comments associated with them. I learned that one must find and delete the associated comments, and then delete the post. 

## Usage

Navigate to the deployed application on heroku, sign up, make your own posts, view posts from other people and comment on them! Nothing more needs to be said.
